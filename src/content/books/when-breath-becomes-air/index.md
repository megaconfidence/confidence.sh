Most times the preoccupations of this world cause us to be oblivious to our own mortality, and we get carried away in the pursuit of unimportant and fleeting things. The truth is we don't need to be terminally ill to become aware of this fact, we could die in an accident at any moment and all of our dreams go up in flames. 'When breath becomes air' explores the idea of how we choose to spend our time when we realize we don't have much left.

This was a good read!

A friend shared this lecture by Randy Pausch who died from cancer a few months
later. It contains a lot of important life-lessons. Enjoy!
