It was my first time in SF and was [having a lot of
fun](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/megaconfidence_last-week-in-sanfrancisco-was-awesome-activity-7397215887625289729-Cqzt). I did the first version
of my talk "LLM Is Now the Drone Pilot. What Could Go Wrong?" at a meetup held
in the Cloudflare SF office and it went pretty well. The agent flew the drone
and all the nerds were happy every after!

Here's my deck:

Sorry this wasn't recorded but I've got some photos:

Almost forgot, I also did a demo video on Twitter:
