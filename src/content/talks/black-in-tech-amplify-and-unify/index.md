It’s black history month and this October, I got invited to a panel discussion on being a black tech professional. This event was hosted in the Cloudflare London office and we had an incredible Jamaican dinner with rice and jerk chicken. It was a warm and intimate event, and we had lots of black people from across Britain in attendance.

There were three other guest speakers on the panel with me. We had: Daisy Auma (Technical Writer, Cloudflare), Natalie Narh (Co-founder & CEO, New Comma) and Richard Kuti (Inclusion Lead, AND Digital). The panel was moderated by our very own lovely Maddy Onyehara. We shared our journeys into tech, the challenges we’ve faced as people of color, and the learnings we’ve had along the way to inspire and encourage others.

Here’s a recording of the event
