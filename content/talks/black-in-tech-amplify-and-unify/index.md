Itâ€™s black history month and this October, I got invited to a panel discussion on being a black tech professional. This event was hosted in the Cloudflare London office and we had an incredible Jamaican dinner with rice and jerk chicken. It was a warm and intimate event, and we had lots of black people from across Britain in attendance.

There were three other guest speakers on the panel with me. We had: Daisy Auma (Technical Writer, Cloudflare), Natalie Narh (Co-founder & CEO, New Comma) and Richard Kuti (Inclusion Lead, AND Digital). The panel was moderated by our very own lovely Maddy Onyehara. We shared our journeys into tech, the challenges weâ€™ve faced as people of color, and the learnings weâ€™ve had along the way to inspire and encourage others.

Hereâ€™s a recording of the event
