I was delighted to give my first in-person Google I/O talk in Lagos last weekend. It was
turbo charged talk and ended with interesting in the QA session after a live
demo illustrating how easy it is to integrate WebAssembly into existing
applications. Here's a [link](https://wasm-fib-calculator.netlify.app/) to the demo built during the talk, and it's [GitHub](https://github.com/megaconfidence/wasm-fib-calculator)
repository.

<!-- ## Summary -->
<!---->
<!-- WebAssembly is an awesome new technology (released in 2015) that many developers are unaware of, although bringing a lot of cost savings and performance benefits to the table. But what is WebAssembly? WebAssembly is a compilation target for other programming languages (C, C++, Python, Rust, Java), enabling the execution of these languages in a secure sandbox either on the server or in the browser environment. -->
<!---->
<!-- WebAssembly unlocks a lot of potentials because it is designed to be lightweight and performant. Thus, WebAssembly is able to execute programs at near native speeds even while running in a browser environment, enabling programs built with WebAssembly to be over eight times faster than their JavaScript counterparts. -->
<!---->
<!-- WebAssembly also offers a beautiful interface for containerization. Because all programs executed in WebAssembly are completely isolated from the host, applications can be executed more securely (as they specifically need to request io, network & storage access), and deployed easily because all program dependencies are contained in its modules. On this point, WebAssembly containers are more secure, faster and less resource intensive than today's industry standard for containerization technology. -->
<!---->
<!-- Perhaps, the best part of WebAssembly is that developers do not need to learn a new tech stack or programming language to benefit from it. Since all major programming languages can be compiled into WebAssembly, developers can stick to the languages they know and love while benefiting from all the features that WebAssembly offers. It's a win-win. -->
<!---->
<!-- That said, WebAssembly is a relatively new technology and still have a few rough edges, but each day we see new tech giants adopt it, and that goes to show how promising WebAssembly is. -->
