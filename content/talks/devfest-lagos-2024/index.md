DevFest Lagos this year was so lit ðŸ”¥

DefestFest Lagos, is one of the biggest tech events in West Africa sponsored by Google. This year was such an exceptional event.f Lots of people attended (over 2.5k attendees) and I got to hangout with folks from AWS, Twillio, Google, Arm among others. Lotâ€™s of young tech talents came and they all had that #buildthings attitude. It was amazing!

I gave a talk on building offline-first apps with modern browser APIs. Then we did a demo of taking an online-only app, to make it run 100% offline as a PWA. Hereâ€™s the demo link https://dino.megaconfidence.workers.dev/

I had a really good time in Lagos ðŸ‡³ðŸ‡¬
