Took my first ever trip to Dublin ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡ª to Stripe's HQ to do a talk on building
agentic real-time applications. Image speaking to a Stripe powered store,
browsing through the catalogue and making purchases through an agent. This talk
shows how to build such agentic expeirences with Cloudflare Workers.
