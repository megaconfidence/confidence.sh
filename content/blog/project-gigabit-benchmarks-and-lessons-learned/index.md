About two months ago I share a blog post detailing my plan to upgrade my home network bandwidth. The max speed I could get out of my old hardware was 100Mb/s which would have been fine if it were 1999, but I needed more speed. So I did my research and realized it wouldnâ€™t cost so much to upgrade my networkâ€™s bandwidth to 2500Mb/s (2.5Gb/s). I did some more research, concluded what hardware to buy, and [documented my thoughts in this article](https://confidence.sh/blog/project-gigabit-upgrading-my-home-network-bandwidth-to-25-gigabits/).

>ðŸ’¡ Donâ€™t forget to check out [part 1](https://confidence.sh/blog/project-gigabit-upgrading-my-home-network-bandwidth-to-25-gigabits/) of this series if you havenâ€™t done so

All items were delivered quickly and I finished the setup using the architecture detailed in the first article. After completing the setup process, Iâ€™ve been tweaking the hardware and software side of things to get as much performance as I can. Hereâ€™s a quick look at my networking shelf (a huge upgrade from my TV closet)

The best part is I can steam 4k mkv files over WiFi with zero buffering, I bet I could also edit videos over WiFi but havenâ€™t gotten around to it yet. Okay, Iâ€™ve been keeping you waiting, so letâ€™s look at the benchmarks! 

## Benchmarks

My local routerâ€™s network bandwidth is a max of 2500mb per second. Iâ€™m yet to hit that limit but various attempts of tweaking have gotten me close to that number, but still not there yet. I use [Iperf3](https://iperf.fr/iperf-download.php) for my benchmarks and have it installed on my router, NAS, and main server. You should check it out, itâ€™s really cool!

First benchmark with no software/hardware massaging:

In case you didnâ€™t get the gist, itâ€™s pretty pathetic. At this point, I was only hitting 95Mb/s out of 2500Mb/s. To put things in perspective, itâ€™s 3.8% of my network's actual capacity. After some debugging, I discovered that the CAT5e cable I used was the bottleneck. I swapped it out for a CAT6 cable and things started to look better:

Finally! Weâ€™re reaching gigabit speeds at 934Mb/s, approximately 40% of my network's max bandwidth. This was expected because the Raspberry Piâ€™s Ethernet bus can only switch a max of 1 gigabit per second(1000Mb/s). I overcame this bottleneck by [getting an Ethernet to USB adapter](https://confidence.sh/blog/project-gigabit-upgrading-my-home-network-bandwidth-to-25-gigabits/#4-home-server) so I could bypass the Ethernet bus, and use the USB bus which has a much faster bandwidth. I followed the steps on [Jiriâ€™s blog](https://www.jiribrejcha.net/2022/07/plugable-2-5-gigabit-ethernet-to-usb-3-0-multigigabit-adapter/) to install the drivers and the results donâ€™t lie:

Superb, now weâ€™re above the gigabit limit at 1.73Gb/s, which is 70% of my network's max bandwidth. Itâ€™s not quite at 100%, but Iâ€™m pleased with the results for now and Iâ€™ll be making more tweaks in the coming months to get as close as possible to 2.5Gb/s.

I stumbled into a forum that suggested enabling jumbo frames on and overclocking the Pi to reach the desired 2.5Gb/s speed. Iâ€™m yet to set it up but feel free to take a look [here](https://forums.raspberrypi.com/viewtopic.php?t=278985#p1787271) if youâ€™re interested.

## Lessons Learned

This has been a really hands-on project and Iâ€™ve learned a lot. I practically had no networking experience before this, but through the magic of the internet, I can *almost* call myself a network engineer ðŸ˜….

A few takeaways (and opinions) from my experience working on this project are:

- Stay away from x86 machines. They are expensive, hot, slow, and power-hungry. My main server and NAS are Raspberry Pi 4s with ARM CPUs and are absolutely efficient. My local router is an x86 mini PC and runs very hot. I couldnâ€™t get an ARM equivalent pc with 2.5Gb/s networking and 4 LAN ports, so I had to go with this one. Things could change soon and Iâ€™ll replace it.
- Cooling is very important. The cooler your devices are, the faster they run. I previously had my home lab in a TV closet (which was fine while it lasted), but I had to move my gear to a shelf because Iâ€™m running more powerful hardware that requires proper cooling to maintain efficiency. So, donâ€™t forget to always keep em cool.
- Every inch of hardware (and software) of your networking infrastructure is important, so donâ€™t try to be cheap when buying Ethernet cables as I did. As I showed in the first benchmark above, bad cables could be a serious bottleneck, and the same goes for every other hardware or software accessory you choose to go with.
- Always optimize to get better results. So know your hardwareâ€™s max bandwidth and constantly make optimizations to get as close to the lab results as possible. This sometimes involves buying enhancement hardware i.e a USB to Ethernet adapter or new cables etc. Some optimizations could also be software base, such as installing up-to-date drivers for your networking interfaces, etc. My advice: reach for the stars, or get as close as you can to them.
