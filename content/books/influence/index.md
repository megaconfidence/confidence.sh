Loved this book so much that I'm putting it in my top 5. Here are my notes from
reading, you should definitely read it too:

- The principle of perceptual contrast states that the perception of situations can be altered by changing what precedes them. For instance, a girl fabricating a dramatic story to her parents—claiming she was in an accident, pregnant, and afflicted with an STD—only to later reveal it as a ploy to put her Chemistry grade in perspective. This principle is commonly utilized by salespeople who present the highest-priced items first, making subsequent options appear more affordable. Real estate agencies also employ this tactic by showcasing overpriced properties initially to enhance the appeal of later, more reasonable options.

- The principle of reciprocation suggests that we feel obliged to repay what we receive from others. Even a small initial favor can lead to a sense of indebtedness and result in agreeing to larger requests later on. Individuals are more likely to comply with requests after receiving a gift, and this sense of reciprocity can persist over time. Businesses often offer free samples to trigger this principle. Moreover, reciprocating concessions during negotiations and making a larger request before a smaller one can exploit this principle effectively.

- The principle of liking asserts that people are more susceptible to influence from those they admire. Factors such as physical attractiveness, similarity, and praise play significant roles in fostering liking. Genuine compliments, especially when delivered indirectly, can enhance this effect. Regular contact and association with positive qualities also contribute to increased liking, as seen in marketing strategies involving popular figures.

- The principle of social proof suggests that people determine what is correct by observing others' behavior. The greater the number of individuals supporting an idea, the more likely an individual is to perceive it as correct. This principle is particularly potent when individuals are uncertain about how to act and seek guidance from others.

- The principle of authority asserts that people tend to accept opinions or instructions from experts without questioning them. Symbols of authority, such as titles or attire, can further influence this perception. Communicators can enhance their credibility by admitting weaknesses early in their presentations.

- The principle of scarcity highlights people's tendency to desire items more when they perceive them as limited or scarce. Techniques such as emphasizing limited supply or time constraints can enhance the perceived value of items. Reiterating recipients' freedom to decline can paradoxically increase compliance.

- The principle of consistency suggests that individuals strive to maintain consistency between their beliefs and actions. Once a commitment is made, there is pressure to uphold it, shaping one's self-image and future behavior. Obtaining written commitments and making public declarations can reinforce this principle.

- To encourage compliance, it's effective to elicit verbal commitments, ideally in a public forum. Reminding individuals of their previous commitments can also increase compliance.

- The principle of unity emphasizes the importance of shared identity in fostering compliance. Highlighting shared experiences or familial connections can strengthen bonds and increase willingness to comply. Engaging in activities that promote unity, such as synchronized actions or mutual disclosure, can accelerate relationship development.

These principles are also used collectively when achieving specific goals:

- Cultivating a positive relationship: Unity, Linking, Reciprocation
- Reducing uncertainty: Authority, Social Proof
- Motivating action: Scarcity, Consistency, Rejection then retreat
