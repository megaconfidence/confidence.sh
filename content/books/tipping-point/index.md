Like you already guessed this book was no different from many of the other
phenomenal Malcolm Gladwell has written. Sometimes I wonder if he exists in the
same world as the rest of us.

Here are some of my notes from the _Tipping point_:

- The law of the few: A tiny subset of individuals does the majority of the work needed for an epidemic to tip. They are the mavens, the connectors and the salesman
- Create maven traps to figure out who your mavens are. Then test new ideas on them
- Stickiness is a critical factor about tipping. If you don't remember what I tell you, you can't change your behavior. Your message hast to be memorable
- To make a message sticky, it has to be practical and personal
- In finding out new opportunities or ideas, your acquaintances (weak ties) are more valuable than close friends, because friends occupy the same world as you do and know what you know
- Context matters. Use environmental changes to signal changes and influence behaviors
